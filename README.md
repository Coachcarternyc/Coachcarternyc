Hi, I'm Isaiah. I'm a Front End Developer with a love for animation inspired by 90's cartoons and video games. I've gotten my start in the freelance sector but I'm currently looking to branch into a more professional setting. 

I'm currently looking to expand my JavaScript skillset as this has been the most challenging part of my learning.
